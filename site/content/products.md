        We believe that beautiful wood has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow wood lovers and learn about
        wood restoration techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. Half of The full price you pay goes to the local communities that support our efforts and the other half to the artist.
